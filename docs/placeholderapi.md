# PlaceholderAPI

We hook into the plugin [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) to allow you to hook 
Factions info into other plugins.

## Internal Placeholders
Spots that you can use placeholders from other plugins in FactionsUUID text:

* `/f show`
* scoreboards
* name tag prefix

## External Placeholders
These are placeholders you can use in other plugins (or the places listed above) that will hook into FactionsUUID.

### Relations
The following can be used in plugins that support PlaceholderAPI relational placeholders.

Relational Placeholder | Description
--- | ---
%rel_factionsuuid_relation% | The relation between the 2 players
%rel_factionsuuid_relation_color% | Color of the relation between the 2 players

### Players
The rest of the placeholders should be usable by any plugin supporting placeholders.

--- | ---
%factionsuuid_player_name% | The player's name
%factionsuuid_player_lastseen% | Last time the player was seen on the server or their online status

%factionsuuid_player_map_#% | Sidebar map (replace # with row number starting with 1)

### Factions

**Fun fact!** You can edit any placeholder below to say `faction_territory` instead and it will display
the information for the faction in which the player is presently standing. For example, 
`%factionsuuid_faction_territory_name%` will display the name of the faction that owns the chunk the player is
standing inside at the moment it is queried.
