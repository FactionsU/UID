&lt;rant&gt;  
I'd appreciate it if you could [pay for the plugin](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsuuid.1035/) if your 
server makes money. If you only run your server for your kids or some friends and don't make any money, 
then I don't want to stop you from doing so by forcing you to buy a plugin. If that's the case, 
then just open a ticket on Discord, and we can work something out.

The repo is open because of that and because I still hope to see people contributing upstream :)  
&lt;/rant&gt;

This plugin will allow the players on the server to create factions/guilds. The factions can claim territory 
that will be protected from non-members. Factions can forge alliances and declare themselves enemies with others. 
Land may be taken from other factions through war.

The goals of this plugin:

 * The players should be able to take care of anti-griefing themselves.
 * Inspire politics and intrigues on your server.
 * Guilding and team spirit! :)
